# logistic-regression-from-scratch
This repository has the implementation of Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch, using SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent). Scikit Learn library is not used.

Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm which is an example of supervised machine learning. It is used to predict the probability of a binary (yes/no) event occurring. An example of logistic regression could be applying machine learning to determine if a person is likely to be infected with COVID-19 or not.<br>
Logistic Regression can be used using Scikit Learn's SGDClassifier module with loss as 'log_loss' but here in this project, we are implementing Logistic Regression from scratch, without using Scikit Learn library. To implement from scratch, we need to know what is Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) algorithm.<br>
